// create an entries array to store input numbers

//create a total this is what the answer will be equal too.

// create a var called temp. temp should show the numbers you are selecting temporarily e.g 3 shows 3 the press + and 4 shows either 4/7

//Get a number add it to temp var

//got a symbol other than equals add temp to entries var

//if AC clear temp and entries

//if CE clear teh last entry(number in temp)

//change multiple symbol to multiply temp, push into entries and then clear temp

//change divide symbol  to divide temp, push into entries and then clear temp

//got equals sign, preform big calculation

  //push temp
  //create new var called nt 
  //equal to number function running entries
  //run a for loop
  //create to new vars to store the number entries
  //create new var to store symbols from entries

  //if symbol === - make nt -= nextNum
  //etc for other symbols

  // create increment i++ so it runs through until end.

  // swap - symbol so input can handle negative numbered answeres

  //push number val
